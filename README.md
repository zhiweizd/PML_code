# PML_code

this is PML-lc code, we provide the datasets used in our experiment, but please note that they are raw datasets without added noise labels. 

'ml_yeast.mat' has been added noisy labels.

These datasets are available at the Mulan Library (https://mulan.sourceforge.net) and the Sourceforge (https://meka.sourceforge.net/#datasets).
