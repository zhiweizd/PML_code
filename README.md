# PML_code

this is PML-LC source code, we have provided the datasets used in our experiment without imdb dataset, because it's a file biggerer than 25MB. 

Please note that they are raw datasets without added noise labels!

'ml_yeast.mat' has been added noisy labels.

These datasets are available at the Mulan Library (https://mulan.sourceforge.net) and the Sourceforge (https://meka.sourceforge.net/#datasets).
